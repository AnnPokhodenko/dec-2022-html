    spouse of
    Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds), lazy,

<p><i><b>Lisa Marie Simpson</b></i> (born May 9, 1983)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family
    and one of the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series. Lisa's high intellect and left-wing
    political stance creates a barrier between her and other children her age; therefore she is considered a bit of a
    loner and social outcast.</p>
